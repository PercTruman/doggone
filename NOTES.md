### Doggone
______
An  app designed to help a owners re-connect with their lost dog(s).  A user, after logging in,  can either be a Finder or an Owner.  As a finder, the user can create a sighting, which will consist of a map with a pin in it,  a verbal description of the dog, and the date of the sighting.  Also, the finder can indicate whether or not they've taken the dog to their home, a shelter, or elsewhere. The finder can also browse through postings of lost dog images to indicate that they've seen that dog with a time/location.
Althernatively, the finder can view a page of breeds to help describe the dog they've seen. (AKC)

An owner, after logging in,  can create a profile of their missing dog, as well as browse/search the current listings of sightings in that area (pictures/locations). They can upload a picture of their dog to the app. 

Both owners and finders can have privately kept contact information that they can choose to divulge or not (email addresses/ phone numbers).
